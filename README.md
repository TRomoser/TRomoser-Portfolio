Get Together
GetTogether is a Full-stack, full CRUD web application that we (a team of three web developers) designed to bring individuals closer to their community by making it easy to organize local and affordable events for all ages. We created GetTogether using the concept of 'mob programming,' Django, Python, HTML, CSS, and DTL, and Heroku for deployment. The app allows visitors to sign up or login, view events in three different cities, create events in any of those cities, comment on past and upcoming events, and rate past events. Our team's mission was to create a community-centric app that makes finding events and putting on events simple and fun. We should GetTogether!
